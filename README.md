# Songwriting Resources

This page contains links that we have found useful as a collective when writing songs.

It is strongly tailored towards working with Ableton Live as this is the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) that the founding members use to compose music.

If you don't have Ableton Live installed you can [sign up for a free 90 day trial](https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/).

Use the shortcut `Ctrl` + `D` (Windows) or `⌘` + `D` (Macintosh) to bookmark this page for future reference.
